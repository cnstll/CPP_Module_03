## Notes
When a class inherit from another class, the parent class is not copied into the derived class. 
The derived class is rather a mix of both classes: partly parent class, partly derived class.
The most derived class is built after each one of its parent classes is built - by using their respective constructors.
Access in the derived class to member attributes or member functions of the parent class can be changed with the access specifiers "public", "protected" or "private"
